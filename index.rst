The Immunity DOCS!
==================

Surveillance Self-Defense (SSD) exists to answer two main questions:
What can the government legally do to spy on your computer data and
communications? And what can you legally do to protect yourself against
such spying?

After an introductory discussion of how you should think about making
security decisions â€” it’s all about `Risk Management`_ â€” we’ll be
answering those two questions for three types of data:

First, we’re going to talk about the threat to the `Data Stored on Your
Computer`_ posed by searches and seizures by law enforcement, as well as
subpoenas demanding your records.

Second, we’re going to talk about the threat to your `Data on the
Wire`_ â€” that is, your data as it’s being transmitted â€” posed by
wiretapping and other real-time surveillance of your telephone and
Internet communications by law enforcement.

Third, we’re going to describe the information about you that is stored
by `third parties`_ like your phone company and your Internet service
provider, and how law enforcement officials can get it.

In each of these three sections, we’re going to give you practical
advice about how to protect your private data against law enforcement
agents.

In a fourth section, we’ll also provide some basic information about
the U.S. government’s expanded legal authority when it comes to `Foreign
Intelligence and Terrorism Investigations`_.


Finally, we’ve collected several articles about specific `defensive
technologies`_ that you can use to protect your privacy, which are
linked to from the other sections or can be accessed individually. So,
for example, if you’re only looking for information about how to
`securely delete`_ your files, or how to use `encryption`_ to protect
the privacy of your `emails`_ or `instant messages`_, you can just
directly visit that article.

Legal disclaimer: This guide is for informational purposes only and
does not constitute legal advice. EFF’s aim is to provide a general
description of the legal and technical issues surrounding you or your
organization’s computer and communications security, and different
factual situations and different legal jurisdictions will result in
different answers to a number of questions. Therefore, please do not act
on this legal information alone; if you have any specific legal
problems, issues, or questions, seek a complete review of your situation
with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.
