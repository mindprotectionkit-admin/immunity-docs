Counter Surveillance
====================

What Can I Do To Protect Myself?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the last section, you learned that wiretapping and pen-trap tapping
are powerful and routine government surveillance techniques, and got an
idea of how often those techniques are legally used. In this section,
you’ll learn how to defend yourself against such real-time
communications surveillance. As we’ll describe in detail below, unless
you take specific technical measures to protect your communications
against\ `wiretapping`_ or `traffic analysis`_ — such as using
`encryption`_ to scramble your messages — your best defense is to use
the communications methods that possess the strongest and clearest legal
protections: postal mail and landline telephones.

Avoid SMS Text Messages
=======================

Avoid SMS Text Messages If You Can
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text messaging over your cell phone using SMS can be an incredibly quick
and convenient way of communicating short messages, but from a privacy
perspective, it poses some serious problems. First, just like your cell
phone conversations, SMS text messages sent to and from your cell phone
can easily be intercepted over radio with minimal equipment and without
any cooperation from the cell phone provider. Second, just like with
your cell phone conversations, it’s unclear whether the Fourth Amendment
protects the radio signals that carry your SMS messages against
interception. This uncertainty increases the possibility that the
government may intercept such communications without a probable cause
warrant. Third, and unlike your cell phone calls, SMS messages are
“electronic communications” rather than “wire communications,” and
therefore aren’t protected by the Wiretap Act’s exclusionary rule. That
means the statute would allow the government to use your messages
against you in a criminal case, even if they were intercepted without a
wiretap order in violation of the statute. Finally, although the Wiretap
Act clearly does require the government to obtain a wiretap order before
intercepting SMS messages, just as with any other “electronic
communication,” we have heard anecdotal reports of the government
intercepting SMS messages without wiretap orders, instead using the
much-easier-to-obtain pen/trap orders. These reports are bolstered by
known cases where the government has obtained the content of stored SMS
messages under the lesser standards reserved for non-content
communications records. Putting all these factors together, we currently
consider SMS messages to be highly vulnerable to government wiretapping,
and recommend reserving that mode of communication for only the most
trivial of communications, if you use it at all. The only exception is
if you use encryption to protect your SMS messages. For now, SMS
encryption software for cell phones is still quite rare, though you can
find information about such software for Java-enabled phones `here`_.

Choosing a Communication Method
===============================

Old Ways are Often the Best Ways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Considering the government’s broad capability to wiretap communications,
there isn’t much difference in the technical risk that wiretapping poses
to your phone calls versus your emails versus your SMS text messages.
However, as described in the last section, there are differences in the
legal protections for these modes of communication, and as will be
described later in this section, there may be technical steps that you
can take — such as `encrypting`_ your communications — that may be
easier or harder depending on which communications method you choose.
So, when thinking about securing your communications against
eavesdropping and wiretapping, your first choice — whether to meet in
person, call on the telephone, write an email, or tap out an SMS text or
IM message — is also your most important choice. As you’ll see below,
the least technically sophisticated modes of communication like
face-to-face conversations and landline telephone conversations are
often the most secure against unwanted eavesdropping, unless you and
those you communicate with have mastered how to encrypt your Internet
communications.
